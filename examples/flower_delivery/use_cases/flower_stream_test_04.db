% Scenario 2:
% In the following scenarios we assume that there are 3 stores (numbered 1,2,3).
% The map, hence, is divided into three regions.
%
% Pre-conditions:
% Drivers E,F,G,H,I,J,K are in region 3
% Driver F had 10 delivery alerts during previous 19 deliveries.
%
% 00:00 Store 3 receives an order (System receives "delivery request" event).
%
% 00:01 System matches drivers F,G,H,I,J,K  by location and ranking (Driver E
%       is filtered out due     to his low rating).
%
% 00:02 Bid request is sent to drivers F,G,H,I,J,K .
%
% 00:03 Drivers F,G,H,I,J,K  respond with "delivery bid", provide their current
%       location and commit a pick-up time.
%
% 00:03-00:05.Store doesn't perform manual assignment (Alert is sent both to
%       the store and the system manager).
%
% 00:06 Driver F is chosen by the store (manual assignment is finally performed
%       after a  3 minute delay). Assignment is sent to driver F. Pick-up time
%       and delivery time is set.
%
% 00:10 Driver F arrives to the store while exceeding pick-up time by 6 minutes
%       (Pick-Up Alert expected). Pick-up confirmation is set.
%
% 00:25 F delivers the flowers to the customer while exceeding delivery time by
%       10 minutes (Delivery Alert expected). Delivery confirmation is provided.
%
% 00:31 Rank of F is decreased by one.
