% Scenario 1 (normal flow):
% In the following scenarios we assume that there are 3 stores (numbered 1,2,3).
% The map, hence, is divided into three regions.
%
% Pre-conditions:
% Drivers A,B,C are in region 1.
%
% 00:00 Store 1 receives an order.
% 00:01 System matches drivers A,B,C  by location and ranking.
% 00:02 Store receives drives A,B,C and filters out driver C.
% 00:03 Bid request is sent to drivers A,B
% 00:04 Drivers A,B respond with delivery bid and provide their current location
%       and pickup time.
% 00:05 Driver A is chosen in automatic process by the store.
% 00:05 Assignment is sent to driver A.
% 00:10 A arrives to the store to pick-up the delivery. The store provides
%       pick-up confirmation.
% 00:15 A delivers the flowers to the customer. Delivery confirmation is
%       provided.
% 00:16 Ranking of A is increased by one.
